WIP

WaypointsTW that adds coordinates and user-managed waypoints to your world map.

Roadmap
1. Adding coordinates to fullscreen mode
2. Adding keybind to toggle popup in fullscreen mode
3. Adding a feature to remove waypoints
4. Waypoint memory between reloads/game restarts
5. Ability to add mouseover details about your waypoints
6. Guildie awareness
7. Sharing waypoints in game


Currently, contributions, pull requests, and issues are ignored until this roadmap is done. There's a lot of data and exploration to cover before it's done.
