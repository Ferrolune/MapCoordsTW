WIP

Addon for Turtle WOW that aims to add accurate level ranges and factions for all zones, towns, cities, and point of interests.
The closest addon to this is combination of cartographer and handynotes except this is just even more degenerate.

Basic level ranges and zone/town/city data is added so it's fully usable for that purpose.
POI is the current WIP before we're adding anything else. Should take a month before our research is done.


Roadmap

1. Bugfixes
2. Adding a feature to remove waypoints
3. Waypoint Waypoint memory
4. Waypoint details


Currently, contributions, pull requests, and issues are ignored until this roadmap is done. There's a lot of data and exploration to cover before it's done.
